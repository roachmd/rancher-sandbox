Learn orchestration using the Autopilot method. 

## The why's
1. Well Dev/Ops is [Dead](https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/07/devops-is-dead-long-live-devops/)
2. RancherOS -- Well, 
  * I've deployed Mesosphere/Mesos to prod, 
  * Toyed around with installing Kubernetes,
  * Seen the disaster called UCP,
  * However, in my opinion Rancher actually embraces the Autopilot method the most.
